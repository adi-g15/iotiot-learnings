## Project Management

### Product/Feature Backlog

Keep track of features to add, modification needed. Based on what user wants.

Each product backlog must have:
1. User stories -> detailed feature explanantion (who, what, why)... once done
   in excel, these user stories become issues on gitlab (etc)
2. Bugs

Prioritizing based on:
1. Assumption Testing: test biggest assumptions first
2. MSCW (Must, Should, Could, Wont)
3. BUC (Business/User benefits, Cost)
